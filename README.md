We have used to [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for a long time, and it actually gets the job done! That's why it's the largest project on Github so far.

There are some competitors for Bootstrap like:
- [Foundation by Zurb](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
- [Yaml](http://www.yaml.de/)
- [960 Grid](http://960.gs/)
- [Suzy](http://susy.oddbird.net/)
- [Frameless](http://framelessgrid.com/)

After all these, I was almost forgot my basic origin. Thanks to Udacity Nanodegree Front-end ccourses. I remind them, and I tried to make a responsive design with class of row and classed of col-1 to col-12.

It was it! but it was exsiting for me.
